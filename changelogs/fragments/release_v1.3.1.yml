release_summary: lower variable precedence of null vars in step_ca_cert
bugfixes:
  - Lowers the precedence of `step_ca_fingerprint` and `step_ca_url`, allowing end-users to define these values in a inventory file.
minor_changes:
  - Validate collection against the lastest release of step-ca and step-cli.
known_issues:
  - The collection can fail to pull the latest step-ca and step-cli versions from GitHub when use in large deployments or during repetitive testing.
    This is due to hitting GitHub's API rate limiter (60 unauthenticated request per hour), we recommend setting 'step_ca_version' and 'step_cli_version' (https://github.com/trfore/ansible-smallstep/issues/42#issuecomment-3075048226).
